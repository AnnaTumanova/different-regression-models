# different-regression-models
In this repository I would like to show different regression models and their user cases in our daily life. Also I would like to make an attention to the important issues that can be predicted and solved with such easy models.  
I used basic of the scikit-learn library, numpy, pandas and matplotlib for the visualisatons.
